# Carl Cassar

I'm **@carlcassar** on [X](https://www.x.com/carlcassar), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/carlcassar) and [Github](https://www.github.com/carlcassar) . I've been making websites and apps [for well over ten years](https://www.carlcassar.com/articles/evolution-of-my-blog-a-wayback-machine-retrospective). I've got a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and a Masters Degree in Information Security. I love to learn new things and share my knowledge with others.

I have an active blog at [carlcassar.com](https://www.carlcassar.com). I write about:
- [PHP](https://www.carlcassar.com/tags/php)
- [Laravel](https://www.carlcassar.com/tags/laravel)
- [Javascript](https://www.carlcassar.com/tags/javascript) 
- [AWS](https://www.carlcassar.com/tags/aws) 

and [other interesting topics](https://www.carlcassar.com/tags).

In the past, I worked on enterprise management software and ran a small team of developers, but these days I'm makings apps, packages and websites for my own little enterprise [cassar & co](https://www.cassar.co).
