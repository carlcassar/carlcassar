In a post called [The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up Code](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-code/1544047022294823/), Kent Beck outlines his philosophy on cleaning up code. The article results in a short list of easy-to-follow rules, which I'm sure he would agree are there to be broken.

> 1. If it’s hard, don’t do it
> 2. Start when you’re fresh and stop when you’re tired
> 3. Land each session’s work immediately
> 4. Two reds is a revert
> 5. Practice
> 6. Isolate tidying
